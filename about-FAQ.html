          <h1>MISSION</h1>
          <p><em>Free Food PDX</em> is an organization that strives to connect the people of Portland to food pantries, free meals and urban foraging opportunities. We believe that there is more than enough food to feed our city, and that no one should go hungry simply because they cannot afford to buy groceries. This website is our response to one part of the problems within our food system: an online, easy, user-friendly resource that connects people to free food.</p>
